  <p className='e3'>A Melbourne start-up named UAM Tec wants to create a “Google Street View” for the entire ocean floor by using Autonomous Submarines equipped with advanced technologies including AI and an array of sensors and cameras. The company wants to create the underwater version of Google Maps Street View- which it calls “WaterView”.</p>
  <img src='../../../img/blog5one.jpg' className='e1'/>
  <p className='e3'>The company unveiled its first autonomous submarine at CEBIT 2019 claiming it to be the “first fully autonomous and visual-based mapping submarine to exist in the world”. This submarine has the capability to travel 100km at a depth of 200m, capturing 360-degree visuals with 22 cameras in the meantime, with a battery life of 40 hours.

</p>
<p className='e3'>Founders Benjamin Fleming and Shawn Taylor, who have backgrounds in software and systems development, say that their sub mapping tech has the potential to change our understanding of the world’s oceans. “We want to be able to educate the next generation about everything that exists in our world. The fact that we know more about space than we do about our own oceans is unacceptable with today’s technology”, the founders said in a statement to Business Insider Australia.

<p className='e3'>With this ambitious project, the company offers people an opportunity to discover new marine organisms and also aims to help improve search and rescue operations in the sea. “Not only will we able to discover new species of marine life and track climate change, but in time we will also be able to optimise search and rescue operations, locate wreckages and black boxes, and much more”.
