  <p className='e3'>Google scraps a plan to post more than 100,000 human chest X-rays online days before the information was to go live after learning that they contained personally identifiable information. The data was to be shared in 2017 as part of an AI exhibition.
</p>


  <p className='e3'>The incident occurred in 2017 as part of a joint venture with the National Institutes of Health (NIH). But at a time when Google is rapidly moving into health care and stealthily gathering medical data from millions of patients, it is particularly relevant.
</p>
<p className='e3'>The Washington Post says that while Google and the NIH worked together to delete all X-ray identifying data, Google hurried to reach a self-imposed deadline and did not pay proper attention to these privacy issues.
</p>
    <img src='../../../img/blog23one.jpg' className='e1'/>
    <p className='e3'>Only after being notified by the NIH, Google discovered that the X-rays also held personal information. This data, according to the Post, included “the dates the X-rays were taken and distinctive jewellery that patients were wearing when the X-rays were taken.”

    </p>

    <p className='e3'>The Wall Street Journal released reports on Google’s “Project Nightingale” earlier this week, in which it gathered medical data from millions of patients in 21 US states as a part of an agreement to strengthen the Ascension Medical Group’s record-keeping process. The report prompted a congressional investigation, stating that the Department of Health and Human Services will “seek to learn more information about this mass collection of individuals’ medical records” and ensure that Google has not violated federal law.
