  <p className='e3'>An inquiry into Apple’s credit card allegations has been launched by a US Financial Regulator which gave different credit limits for men and women.
</p>

<p className='e3'>The incident began when a tech entrepreneur David Heinemeier Hansson complained on Twitter that his Apple Card’s credit line was twenty times higher than that given to his wife, although the two file joint tax returns and he’s got the worse credit score.

</p>

<p className='e3'>“The @AppleCard is such a fucking sexist program”, wrote Hansson. “My wife and I filed joint tax returns, live in a community property state, and have been married for a long time. Yet Apple’s black box algorithm thinks I deserve 20x the credit limit she does.”

</p>
<p className='e3'>After Hansson’s allegations became viral, similar incidents were reported by other Apple Card customers. Among them was Steve Wozniak, who founded Apple with Steve Jobs, who said he was given ten times his wife’s credit limit. Wozniak called on the government to investigate the operation of such black-box algorithms that are often said to be biased by experts.

<p className='e3'>
The New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) responded in response to the allegations, that it would investigate the card issued by banking giant Goldman Sachs. Such criticisms play into increasing public knowledge of biased algorithms that are making rising decisions in areas such as health care, housing and recruitment.

<p className='e3'>As Apple launched its credit card earlier this year, it boasted that it would introduce Apple’s elegance and clarity to the confounding financial world. It would be easy and straight forward to use the Apple Card, Apple said, resulting in “a healthier financial life.”
