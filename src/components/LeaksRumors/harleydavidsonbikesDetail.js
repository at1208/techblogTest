  <p className='e3'>Things are about to change. When you first hear about pedal bikes, Harley-Davidson isn’t the name that pops up in your mind. But here we are.</p>

  <p className='e3'>Three new adult-sized electric bicycles are slated to roll off the production lines in 2020, bringing one of the oldest motorcycle companies in the world firmly into the electric vehicle age.

<p className='e3'>The pics are definitely are nice to look at, but riding them would be even sweeter. They haven’t been named yet. But a spokesperson for the company says it’s still “evaluating market opportunities and finalizing design details” before the go into production in 2020.
</p>
<p className='e3'>There are three styles of bike with varying degrees of accessibilities:
</p>
<p className='e3'>
<ul>
<li>A high-step model</li>
<li>A step-through model</li>
<li>The one that’s in between</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p className='e3'>All these models have similar a similar core, with mid-drive motors, internal removable batteries that are flush to the frame, and that special Harley swagger. I mean it’s Harley, can’t be boring.
</p>
<p className='e3'>The company wouldn’t offer up any specs, so we can only speculate on battery size, range and each model’s potential e-bike class. And still no word from the company as to whether it plans to put it’s fun-looking electric moped into production.
