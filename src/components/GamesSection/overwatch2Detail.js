         <p className='e2'>ANNOUNCEMENT -</p>
  <p className='e3'>Overwatch game director Jeff Kaplan officially announced Overwatch 2 at BlizzCon today.
  </p>
  <p className='e3'>The game will feature story missions, similar to some of Overwatch's seasonal events, hero missions, replayable co-op modes, hero leveling up and hero customization. Overwatch 2 will also have a new PvP mode called Push, new maps, and multiple new heroes, including Sojourn, seen in the trailer.
  </p>
  <p className='e2'>KEY UPDATES -</p>
  <p className='e3'>Story missions with the Overwatch heroes.
Hero missions defending cities against Talon agents.
Experience levels and customization options.
Multiple new heroes beyond Overwatch's original cast.
New maps and a new game mode called Push.
</p>
  <p className='e2'>NEW HEROES -</p>
  <p className='e3'>We can only confirm of 2 new heroes ,Sojourn which can be DPS or off tank.
Whereas the long awaited hero Echo which was first shown in Mcree short clip “Reunion” in which we can see Ashe was stealing a box from the train which was in fact Echo and we can see that Mcree already know the Echo before.
Since there is news of 4 characters .
We can only hope for the best.
 </p>

  <p className='e2'>OVERWATCH 2 NEW MAPS -</p>

  <p className='e3'>Kaplan said the game will run on a vastly upgraded engine, allowing for larger PvE maps and an updated look to the original game, which debuted in 2016. Some heroes will also see changes to their standard design .Kaplan likens the new designs to the various incarnations of Batman ‘the style may change, but the character will always be recognizable.’</p>
  <p className='e3'>A new cinematic introduced the sequel. Clearly the cinematic team does not believe in following the meta, as there were no Sigma or Orisa shields in sight. The cinematic also showed Echo. No official word yet on whether she will be playable in Overwatch and Overwatch
Overwatch recently came to Nintendo Switch.
