<p className='e2'>Sound Quality-
</p>

<p className='e3'>
On this price these in-ear earphones are very cheap, basically dime a dozen. Most of the us have very low expectations with their 1000 rupees earphone but these earphones will not let you down,

</p>


<p className='e3'>They are a little more bass heavy than most on this price but they nicely follow an loudness contour matching the natural sensitive of your ear in mids and highs. We put marley through wide range of genres. Everything from Beethoven, to classic jazz, to edm, to rock, to bob marley himself sounded excellent in this. They are far above than expected from most affordable earphones.
</p>

<p className='e3'>
From a practical point of view these earphones are best at noise cancellation. Their ear buds can mold into your ears so easily and comfortably. In terms of distortion, these will ideally produce less than 3% THD (Total Harmonic Distortion) across the majority of the audible spectrum, through many headphones exhibit a higher amount in the lowest sub-bass ranges
